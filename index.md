## Definitions

>- 1. A general definition in psychology: Priming refers to the nonconscious/implicit memory effect in which a response to stimulus is influenced by other perceptual patterns in memory. (WIKI + Psychology Today)
   - Associated patterns in memory is easier to activate: colors vs. fruits; issues vs. political parties.
   - Some related concepts: positive vs. negative priming (ERM); perceptual vs. conceptual (modality vs. semantic) 
   - A "priming paradigm": has important implications in numerous fields and topics. eg. aging, education, political science, media studies, etc.
   - Issues on scientific integrity: replication, bias, unconstructive progress. 
>- 2. A very specific, media politics definition: "Priming refers to the capacity of the media to isolate particular issues, events, or themes in the news as criteria for evaluating politicians." (Ansolabehere, Behr, and Iyengar, 1993).
   - An example of the application of pyschological concepts in media studies and political science.
   - Perceived importantce of issues vs. impact on opinions and evaluations.
   - Historically, an extension to the agenda setting effects.
